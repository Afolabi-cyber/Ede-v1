# 🧠 Yoruba-to-English Transformer Translation Model (Dialect Independent)

This repository contains a powerful **Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** model that translates **Yoruba (all dialects)** to **English**. Built from scratch using TensorFlow, this model is capable of handling major Yoruba dialects such as **Oyo**, **Egba**, **Ijebu**, and others.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Dialect-independent**: Trained to generalize across regional Yoruba variations.
- ✅ **Transformer architecture**: Implemented from scratch using TensorFlow.
- ✅ **Clean & tokenized data pipeline**: Supports both training and inference phases.
- ✅ **Fully offline**: No external APIs or internet connection required.
- ✅ **Easily deployable**: Works in apps, websites, or APIs.
